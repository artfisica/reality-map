# Changelog

Editions are dated and versioned together. When a court rules, a policy changes
or new primary evidence appears, the ledger row is updated first and the change
is recorded here.

## 0.3 — 17 August 2026

- Spanish edition published alongside English, at `/es/`.
- Case studies reordered: the Caribbean killings become IV, Venezuela becomes V.
- Claim anchors are now stable. They no longer come from row order, so adding a
  claim does not renumber the ones below it or break an existing citation.
- An unrecognised classification now fails the build instead of silently
  becoming a record.
- Authorial context is parsed and displayed as its own section, distinct from
  the numbered sources.
- The source description now names the kinds of source actually present,
  including attributed investigative reporting.
- Added `scripts/validate.py` and a pull-request check. It also verifies the
  byline spelling, that each document declares the edition's version and date,
  and that semantic claim ids match across the two editions.
- Prohibited Spanish terminology narrowed to the nouns `licitud` and
  `ilicitud`. The adjectives stay available, because "uso ilícito de la fuerza"
  is legally precise.
- Aggregate source references are declared in `site.aggregate_patterns` and
  reported as notes rather than warnings.
- The social card is regenerated on every build, so it cannot report a stale
  claim count.
- The content licence reserves all rights and no longer carries editorial
  instructions; open questions moved to `DECISIONS.md`.
- Synchronized the definitive fourteen-document corpus, including the
  authorial method derived from *Miedo* and *Dolor*, the Caribbean-to-Venezuela
  chronology, Executive Order 14373, the BBC investigation and the analysis of
  de facto tutelage.
- Both editions now contain the same 45 claims in the same case-study order.
- Every claim has a permanent semantic identifier shared by its English and
  Spanish versions.
- Added the English `documentary fact` evidence match used by the Executive
  Order 14373 claim.

## 0.2 — 17 August 2026

- Spanish drafts of the manual and the five case studies.

## 0.1 — 16 August 2026

- First edition: the manual, five case studies and the ledger, in English.
